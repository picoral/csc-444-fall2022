You will learn to use some of the most popular data visualization libraries, you will learn how they are implemented, and their limitations.\nPrinciples: These principles are based on perceptual psychology and physiology, and how they constraint the algorithms for displaying data effectively and efficiently. They also intertwine with a collection of design principles the design process that includes abstracting, encoding, and interacting with data.\nTechniques: You will learn the fundamental algorithms behind many of the techniques created to display data effectively.\n\nExpected Learning Outcomes\nExpected outcomes for Principles\n\nUse appropriate scales of measurement in visualizations\nChoose appropriate perceptual channels and color vision for different elements in visualizations\nRecognize and avoid pitfalls of the effect of preattentiveness\nDescribe the pros and cons of interaction and animation\nEmploy filtering, aggregation, linked views, and visual querying\nApply these principles for informed critique and analyzing the visualization design processes\n\nExpected outcomes for Mechanics\n\nImplement basics in HTML, CSS, Scalable Vector Graphics, Javascript\nBuild visualizations in d3 using the concepts of selections, scales, transitions, events\n\nExpected outcomes for Techniques\n\nBuild basic visualizations that employ scatterplots, line plots, small multiples\nExplain the challenges of visualizing high-dimensional data and possible methods of dimensionality reduction\nState the pros and cons of visualizing hierarchies and networks\nBuild visualization of maps and 2D scalar fields: i.e. choropleths, heatmaps, and isocontours.\nExtend these visualizations to 3D data through isosurfaces and direct volume rendering\nBuild visualization for vector fields that utilize streamlines and derived fields\n\n(These learning outcomes are derived from ones developed by Joshua A. Levine, Carlos Scheidegger and other faculty at the UA)."

If you wish to change your preferred name or pronoun in the UAccess system, please use the following guidelines: \nPreferred name: University of Arizona students may choose to identify themselves within the University community using a preferred first name that differs from their official/legal name. A student’s preferred name will appear instead of the person’s official/legal first name in select University-related systems and documents, provided that the name is not being used for the purpose of misrepresentation. Students are able to update their preferred names in UAccess.\nPronouns: Students may designate pronouns they use to identify themselves. Instructors and staff are encouraged to use pronouns for people that they use for themselves as a sign of respect and inclusion. Students are able to update and edit their pronouns in UAccess.\nMore information on updating your preferred name and pronouns is available on the Office of the Registrar site at https://www.registrar.arizona.edu/."
