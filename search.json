The course will present the foundations of graphic design, perceptual psychology and cognitive science, as well as the algorithmic basis for many for the visualization techniques. While statistical techniques may determine correlations among the data, visualization helps us frame what questions to ask.\nThe course is targeted at students looking for effective ways of understanding data from their own fields, as well as students interested in learning the fundamentals that will enable them to build and improve the state of the art. The successful student will learn to design, critique and improve data visualizations.\n\n\nCourse Prerequisites\nThe prerequisite for this course are both CSC 335 (Object-Oriented Programming and Design) and CSC 345 (Analysis of Discrete Structures). While students majoring in areas other than CSC are encouraged to enroll, certain topics may prove challenging. Please contact the instructor if you are unsure if you satisfy the prerequisites.\nWe will write most of our code using the web stack. This means we are targeting modern web browsers, and writing our programs in a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you don’t know these technologies, you will be expected to learn them. CSC 337 (Web Programming) is not a formal pre-requisite for this course, but it might be considered helpful.\n\n\nInstructor and Contact Information\n\nInstructor of Record: Adriana Picoral (she/her/hers)\nOffice: Gould-Simpson 829\nEmail: adrianaps@arizona.edu\nOffice Hours: Mo 3:15-4:45pm and Tu 3:30-5:00pm\nD2L: https://d2l.arizona.edu/d2l/home/1195142\nTA: Tanner Finken (finkent@arizona.edu)\n\n\n\nCourse Format and Teaching Methods\nPrimarily, the format is driven by lectures combined with in-class discussion. Out-of-class activities include readings in relevant textbooks and research papers, programming assignments, take-home exercises, and online discussions.\n\n\n\nObtaining Help\n\nAcademic advising: If you have questions about your academic progress this semester, or your chosen degree program, consider contacting your department’s academic advisor(s).  Your academic advisor and the Advising Resource Center can guide you toward university resources to help you succeed.

Students may not modify content or re-use content for any purpose other than personal educational reasons. All recordings are subject to government and university regulations. Therefore, students accessing unauthorized recordings or using them in a manner inconsistent with with UArizona values and educational policies (Code of Academic Integrity and the Student Code of Conduct) are also subject to civil action.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\nThe content of the course is split roughly in three distinct aspects of visualization: mechanics, principles, and techniques.\nMechanics: You will learn how the modern web stack enables performant and portable data visualization programs. You will learn to use some of the most popular data visualization libraries, you will learn how they are implemented, and their limitations.\nPrinciples: These principles are based on perceptual psychology and physiology, and how they constraint the algorithms for displaying data effectively and efficiently. They also intertwine with a collection of design principles the design process that includes abstracting, encoding, and interacting with data.\nTechniques: You will learn the fundamental algorithms behind many of the techniques created to display data effectively.\n\nExpected Learning Outcomes\nExpected outcomes for Principles\n\nUse appropriate scales of measurement in visualizations\nChoose appropriate perceptual channels and color vision for different elements in visualizations\nRecognize and avoid pitfalls of the effect of preattentiveness\nDescribe the pros and cons of interaction and animation\nEmploy filtering, aggregation, linked views, and visual querying\nApply these principles for informed critique and analyzing the visualization design processes\n\nExpected outcomes for Mechanics\n\nImplement basics in HTML, CSS, Scalable Vector Graphics, Javascript\nBuild visualizations in d3 using the concepts of selections, scales, transitions, events\n\nExpected outcomes for Techniques\n\nBuild basic visualizations that employ scatterplots, line plots, small multiples\nExplain the challenges of visualizing high-dimensional data and possible methods of dimensionality reduction\nState the pros and cons of visualizing hierarchies and networks\nBuild visualization of maps and 2D scalar fields: i.e. choropleths, heatmaps, and isocontours.\nExtend these visualizations to 3D data through isosurfaces and direct volume rendering\nBuild visualization for vector fields that utilize streamlines and derived fields\n\n(These learning outcomes are derived from ones developed by Joshua A. Levine, Carlos Scheidegger and other faculty at the UA).\n\n\n\n\nAbsence and Class Participation Policy\nParticipating in the course and attending lectures and other course events are vital to your learning process. Although attendance is not required, it is highly recommended. Absences may affect your final course grade.
