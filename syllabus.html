<section id="description-of-course" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="description-of-course"><strong>Description of Course</strong></h2>
<p>This course will present the fundamentals of data visualization, the art and science of using a computer to generate visual depictions of data. The course will present the foundations of graphic design, perceptual psychology and cognitive science, as well as the algorithmic basis for many for the visualization techniques. While statistical techniques may determine correlations among the data, visualization helps us frame what questions to ask.</p>
<p>The course is targeted at students looking for effective ways of understanding data from their own fields, as well as students interested in learning the fundamentals that will enable them to build and improve the state of the art. The successful student will learn to design, critique and improve data visualizations.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-prerequisites" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-prerequisites"><strong>Course Prerequisites</strong></h2>
<p>The prerequisite for this course are both CSC 335 (Object-Oriented Programming and Design) and CSC 345 (Analysis of Discrete Structures). While students majoring in areas other than CSC are encouraged to enroll, certain topics may prove challenging. Please contact the instructor if you are unsure if you satisfy the prerequisites.</p>
<p>We will write most of our code using the web stack. This means we are targeting modern web browsers, and writing our programs in a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you don’t know these technologies, you will be expected to learn them. CSC 337 (Web Programming) is not a formal pre-requisite for this course, but it might be considered helpful.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-format-and-teaching-methods" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-format-and-teaching-methods"><strong>Course Format and Teaching Methods</strong></h2>
<p>Primarily, the format is driven by lectures combined with in-class discussion. Out-of-class activities include readings in relevant textbooks and research papers, programming assignments, take-home exercises, and online discussions.<br>

<section id="class-recordings" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="class-recordings"><strong>Class Recordings</strong></h2>
<p>In this course, I may provide some video content in D2L. Students may not modify content or re-use content for any purpose other than personal educational reasons. All recordings are subject to government and university regulations. Therefore, students accessing unauthorized recordings or using them in a manner inconsistent with with <a href="https://www.arizona.edu/purpose-mission-values">UArizona values</a> and educational policies (<a href="https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/student-rights-responsibilities/academic-integrity">Code of Academic Integrity</a> and the <a href="https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/student-rights-responsibilities/student-code-conduct">Student Code of Conduct</a>) are also subject to civil action.</p>
</section>
<section id="course-objectives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-objectives"><strong>Course Objectives</strong></h2>
<p>The content of the course is split roughly in three distinct aspects of visualization: mechanics, principles, and techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanics</strong>: You will learn how the modern web stack enables performant and portable data visualization programs. You will learn to use some of the most popular data visualization libraries, you will learn how they are implemented, and their limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Principles</strong>: These principles are based on perceptual psychology and physiology, and how they constraint the algorithms for displaying data effectively and efficiently. They also intertwine with a collection of design principles the design process that includes abstracting, encoding, and interacting with data.</p>
<p><strong>Techniques</strong>: You will learn the fundamental algorithms behind many of the techniques created to display data effectively.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grading-scale-and-policies"><strong>Grading Scale and Policies</strong></h2>
<p>The instructor and teaching staff will do their best to have grades back to students within one week. This includes, but is not limited to, grades for exams, projects, programming assignments, attendance, and quizzes. Once a grade has been entered for a particular item on the digital grade-book, students have at most 5 days to dispute the grade. This includes disputes related to excuses such as sickness, personal matters, dean’s excuses, etc. If 5 days pass and there has not been such a request, the grade is final.</p>
<p>The correspondence between percentage grade and numeric grade is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Greater than 90% at least an A</p></li>
<li><p>Greater than 80% at least a B</p></li>
<li><p>Greater than 70% at least a C</p></li>
<li><p>Greater than 60% at least a D</p></li>
